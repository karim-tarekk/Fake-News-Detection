# Fake-News-Detection

**With the advent of the technological revolution, it is easier for users to have access to the internet which increases the probability of fake news to spread like a wildfire.**


In this project, Different classification models will be used to detect fake news.

#### Dataset: The dataset contains a list of 1000 text labeled with "fake" or “real“ news.


### The steps will go as follows:
1. Apply the required data cleaning methods.
2. Apply data preprocessing on text data.
3. Compute term frequency.
4. Implement different classification models to investigate the performance of each classifier for detect fake or real news.
5. Mention the best model to detect the fake news

#### Used classification models:
- K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree (DT)
- Logistic Regression (logit)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
